# Tractography filtering quality : comparison between state of art (FA and FOD) and newly developed entropy-based methods

This code provides tools for the evaluation of tractography filtering. The entropy-based method has been developed by MÃ©ghane DECROOCQ and available on [this repository](https://github.com/megdec/tractography-visualization).

Our objective is to compare the quality of the entropy-based method with the method usually used in tractography filtering : Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Fiber Orientation Distributions (FOD).


## Input data

For this comparison, all the data are available in the data directory. We have data for 8 patients (code composed of two letters and three numbers). For each patient, we study 9 nerves : III, V, NF and NF are separated in two parts (example : IIID for right hemisphere, IIIG for left hemisphere).

| Nerve definition | Optic          | Oculomotor          | Trigeminal          | Facial and Vestibulocochlear          | Mixte          |

| Diameter (mm)  | 10                | 5                          | 7                         | 3                                                     | 2                  |

A few nerve are not available. In table X are presented the available nerves for each patient.

For each patient, we have :

- fa.mif (or fa.nii), a 3D-image containing the fractional anisotropy of the fibre
- fod.mif (of fod.nii), a 3D-image containing the spherical harmonics of the fibre orientation distributions
- eddy_corrected_dti.mif, a 3D-image corresponding to the result of the diffusion MRI
- for each nerve :
    - Ground_Truth.tck and Ground_Truth_vox.tck, corresponding to tracks files realised by the expert with the optimal parameters, respectively in millimeters and voxels. We will use it as ground truth for the evaluation
    - for each parameter and each condition of this parameter, Tracks.tck and Tracks_vox.tck, corresponding to tracks files realised with the non-optimal parameters, respectively in millimeters and voxels. (table X)
